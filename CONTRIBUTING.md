# Contributing

## Welcome

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
<https://cla.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent-cookbook/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- üëç - upvote
- üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

- File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

- Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

- The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

- Version of Chef Infra Client

- Your operating system

- Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

- A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally

  - **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

- Errors from the client run

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

- [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

- [ ] Recreate the issue

- [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!
